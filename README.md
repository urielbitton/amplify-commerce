# amplify-commerce
Created React + <3

Inspirations:


Features to add: 
- guest add to cart and checkout features
- add newarrivals, about + contact pages
- let admin create users!
- add chat app inside customer support page (link to client support in site)

Bugs tracking:
- when reloading on coupons-shipping-products edit page, state of edit variable is false,
find a way to set to true
- push picked dates to firestore as a timestamp value

Refactor Firestore DB to use subcollections so the DB is more easily queryable (can use ArrayRemove, etc)

At end of project, configure firestore rules!
